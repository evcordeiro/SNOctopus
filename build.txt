Build instructions:

1) ftp local files to www.sno.wamunity.com/build/
2) test build output www.sno.wamunity.com/build/
3) edit build.txt (this file) with appropriate notes (save last build under history)
4) add/commit/push local to https://evcordeiro@github.com/evcordeiro/SNOctopus.git 

Additional notes:
www.sno.wamunity.com/build/ should be identical to the files on the github repository and presumably be fully functional at any given point, with the obvious exception when a component never worked in the first place.

Use www.sno.wamunity.com/build/test directory for testing
