Build instructions:

1) ftp local files to www.sno.wamunity.com/build/
2) Create a new mysql database to be used by this program 
3) Edit /ui/settings.php and add mysql credentials
4) go to /ui/ on a browser for installation process. 
5) test build output www.sno.wamunity.com/build/
6) edit build.txt (this file) with appropriate notes (save last build under history)
7) add/commit/push local to https://evcordeiro@github.com/evcordeiro/SNOctopus.git 

Additional notes:
www.sno.wamunity.com/build/ should be identical to the files on the github repository and presumably be fully functional at any given point, with the obvious exception when a component never worked in the first place.

Use www.sno.wamunity.com/build/test directory for testing
